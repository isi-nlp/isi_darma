Read the conversation on the right. The participant whose boxes are blue is behaving badly and has been moderated by the moderator bot (in green)
Please pretend to be the toxic participant and continue the conversation, responding as you think they would respond.
Try to capture the attitudes and emotions exhibited by this participant and react to the moderator honestly. If you aren't sure how they would respond, just do your best!
