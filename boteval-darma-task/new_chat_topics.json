[]() a significant body of research examines the racial stereotypes that many employers hold about african american workers (moss and tilly 2001; pager and karafin 2009; waldinger and lichter 2003). qualitative research consistently finds that employers hold stereotypes about black workers as lacking competence, motivation, and \u201csoft skills\u201d as well as having poor employment histories that are often riddled with spells of unemployment (moss and tilly 2001; waldinger and lichter 2003). while much of the research on employers\u2019 stereotypes about black workers focuses on the lower-skilled labor market, higher educational attainment does not protect black individuals from discrimination. field experiments find that college-educated black workers continue to face racial discrimination (gaddis 2015). thus, the negative stereotypes that employers hold about african american workers may play an important role in the production of racial discrimination in hiring for all black workers, not just those in the low-skilled labor market.
