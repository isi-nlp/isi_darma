So, how can we work towards reducing affective polarization and promoting intellectual humility in political discussions?",

                "Moderator: It's understandable that people have their own beliefs and opinions, but it's also important to approach political discussions with an open mind. The goal of intellectual humility is not about changing one's beliefs against their will or forcing them to agree with others' views. Rather, it is about acknowledging the possibility for learning from diverse perspectives and being willing to change certain viewpoints when presented with evidence-based arguments in a respectful manner. Can we all commit ourselves towards promoting more constructive dialogue on this subreddit?",
                "d: Sorry, but I don't need to commit myself towards promoting \"constructive dialogue\" because that's not why I'm on this subreddit. Debating and expressing my opinions is what matters here, not coddling others who can't handle a little disagreement or being told they're wrong. If you want intellectual humility and respectful discussions so badly, then maybe start your own subreddit for it instead of trying to change the culture of this one."
