            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <div>
                We invite you to take part in a research study. Please take as much time as you need to read the consent
                form. You may want to discuss it with your family, friends, or your personal doctor. If you find any of
                the
                language difficult to understand, please ask questions. If you decide to participate, you will be asked
                to
                sign this form. A copy of the signed form will be provided to you for your records.

                <br />

                The U.S. Department of Defense is funding the study.

            <h3>Key Information</h3>
            <div>
                <p>
                    The following is a short summary of this study to help you decide whether you should participate.
                    More
                    detailed information is listed later in this form.
                </p>

                    <li>
                        Being in this research study is voluntary - it is your choice.

                    <li>
                        You are being asked to take part in this study because <b>you can speak English fluently, and you are at least 18 years old.</b> The purpose of this study is to
                        assess the ability of artificial intelligence-based moderators ("bots") to affect online toxic
                        behavior. Your participation in this study will last approximately 10 minutes per conversation
                        you
                        wish to participate in, but you will have multiple opportunities to participate. Procedures will
                        include reading an existing partial online conversation, assuming the persona, attitude,
                        opinion,
                        and behavior of one of the participants in that conversation, and reacting naturally to another
                        participant who tries to alter "your" behavior.

                        There are risks from participating in this study. The most common risks are that you will feel
                        uncomfortable imitating the personality of someone whose views or style are dissimilar from your
                        own, or that you will feel reluctant to discuss the topics of the given conversation. More
                        detailed
                        information about the risks of this study can be found under the “Risk and Discomfort” section.

                        You may not receive any direct benefit from taking part in this study. However, your
                        participation
                        in this study may help us learn how to create better bots and this can lead to less toxic
                        behavior online.

                    <li>
                        If you decide not to participate in this research, your other choices may include finding other
                        tasks on Mechanical Turk that you find of greater interest.

                    <u>Purpose</u>
                </h4>

                <p>
                    The purpose of this study is to know if we can use AI to help reduce discord in heated online
                    conversations. You may be familiar with online discussions in places such as Twitter, Facebook, and
                    Reddit, where acrimony, ad hominem attacks, misunderstandings, and all manner of bad behavior turn
                    civil discourse into a cesspool of toxic rhetoric. When well-meaning moderators step in and try and reason
                    with people who are willing to listen, the rhetoric can be cooled, but this is a time-consuming
                    task, usually using a lot of volunteer effort. We're trying to see if we can make "bots" that can help out
                    humans. We hope to learn where bots can actually get people to listen and change their minds. We
                    recognize that this is going to be hard -- it's even hard for humans to do this! But we think we can
                    create software that is a little better at reasoning with upset people than the software we have
                    today.
                    You are invited as a possible participant because you are an adult who is fluent in English, you are located in a country where you can be a Mechanical Turk worker ("turker") and because you have signaled an interest in this kind of task by clicking on the Mechanical Turk link that took you to this document. About 10,000 participants may take part in the study, though the numbers could be much smaller, depending on how eager people are to participate. This research is being funded by DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.

                    <u>Procedures</u>
                </h4>

                If you decide to take part, this is what will happen:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        We will show you a conversational thread from a discussion forum. We will identify
                        one of
                        the participants in this thread as the participant you are supposed to act as. You should read
                        the
                        thread and try to understand the motivations and attitudes of the participant. We expect the
                        participant will not be particularly kind. They may use profanity, and they may hold viewpoints
                        you
                        disagree with. In your own life, and in your personal online communications, you may not
                        commgetunicate
                        like this! However, we want you to pretend to be this person for the duration of the task.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The conversation will leave off with a moderator who is asking you to stop or change your
                        behavior.
                        The moderator will either be an artificial intelligence or it will be a human. This will be
                        chosen
                        by a random selection, like rolling a die, and you won't be told whether you have a human or an
                        AI.
                        You should respond to the moderator as you would expect the participant to expect. The moderator
                        will likely respond to your response.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Continue to chat back-and forth with the moderator until either you think the conversation has
                        ended
                        or the moderator has ended the conversation. Throughout, continue to act as if you are the
                        participant.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        After the conversation you will be asked several questions about the conversation you had. Think
                        about whether the moderator seemed to understand "your" attitude and whether "your" mind was
                        changed
                        as a result of the conversation.

                <p>
                    Possible risks and discomforts you could experience during this study include feeling offended or
                    nervous at pretending to hold opinions that you do not have. The moderator may also respond to you
                    in
                    ways that you deem offensive or in other ways that lead you to experience unwanted emotions. You can
                    choose to skip the scenario we have selected for you and be given another scenario if you find the
                    subject matter or the participant you are supposed to pretend to be distasteful or offensive.

                    embarrassed.
                    You can choose to skip or stop answering any questions you don't want to.
