It's also important to recognize that gender is a complex and multifaceted concept that goes beyond just biological differences in the brain. Social and cultural factors also play a significant role in shaping gender roles, behaviors, and identities. Therefore, we should approach the topic with an open and critical mind, and base our conclusions on rigorous scientific evidence rather than stereotypes or assumptions.
