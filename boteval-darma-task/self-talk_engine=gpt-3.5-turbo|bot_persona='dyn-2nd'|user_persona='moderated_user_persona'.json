Above all else, we need empathy towards these individuals while still standing firm on our commitment toward seeking truth based on factual evidence rather than baseless conspiracies.\n\nAdditionally , pointing out fact-checking websites like Snopes.com or Politifact could be helpful because such resources are likely more impartial which gives people greater confidence when weighing up facts/sources."
