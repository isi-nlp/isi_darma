2023-04-20 15:51:09.675 | DEBUG    | endpoints.chatgpt:query_completion_api:133 - Output response: Moderator: Let's remember to engage in respectful and open-minded discussions. It is important to recognize that individuals may have different perspectives and experiences. Affective polarization can lead to a lack of respect and willingness to understand opposing views. Intellectual humility, the willingness to change beliefs when presented with evidence, can help to lower this polarization. Let's focus on discussing the issue at hand and avoid attacking individuals or groups.
